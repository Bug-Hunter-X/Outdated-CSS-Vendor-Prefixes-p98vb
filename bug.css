The CSS code uses a vendor prefix that is no longer necessary or supported by modern browsers.  For example, using `-webkit-` or `-moz-` prefixes for properties that have standard support can cause unexpected behavior or rendering issues in some browsers.  This is because the prefixed properties might conflict with the standard properties, leading to unpredictable styles.
