# Outdated CSS Vendor Prefixes

This repository demonstrates a common CSS bug caused by using unnecessary vendor prefixes.  Unnecessary vendor prefixes can lead to inconsistencies in how your styles are rendered across different browsers.  The `bug.css` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.css` shows the corrected version.

**Problem:** Using vendor prefixes for properties with standard support.

**Solution:** Remove outdated prefixes and rely on standard CSS properties.
